			<p>
				<b>It keeps saying the satellite signal strength is too low, even when I'm outside.  Other apps can get a fix, why can't this?</b>
				<ul>Other apps, for instance Google Maps, can also use Google Location Services to get a fix when the GPS unit isn't working properly. My app also has much higher accuracy constraints that it must enforce or the accumulated data would be grossly inaccurate.  Sometimes it can take a minute or two to get the error down to an acceptable range (while outside).  If you've had it running for a couple minutes outside, and still don't have a good fix you'll need to restart the phone. *Update*  I've had some reports that people have had to wait as much as 10+ minutes for the GPS unit to get a usable fix.  Since all my app does is request a fix from Palm's GPS unit, there is nothing I can do about it.  I apologize for the trouble, but it will work if you give it time (and you're outside).</ul>
				<b>I get an error saying I haven't accepted the Terms of Service</b>
				<ul>Go to Location Services (Third page in the launcher), and goto the preferences menu.  From there tap "Locate Me Using" and tap "Google Services".  It will then ask you to accept the terms of service.</ul>
				<b>I get an error saying to ensure GPS fixes are turned on</b>
				<ul>Go to Location Services (Third page in the launcher), and goto the preferences menu.  From there tap "Locate Me Using" and tap "GPS".</ul>
				<b>I get an error saying I'm blacklisted</b>
				<ul>The only time I've seen this happen is when the app asks your permission to use Location Services and you either decline, or close the app without responding.  As far as I know, the only way to clear the error is to restart the phone.</ul>
				<b>Top Speed goes down unexpectedly</b>
				<ul>By default the app will reset the top speed when you shake the phone.  This behavior can be changed in preferences.</ul>
				<b>Whats the deal with the accuracy</b>
				<ul>By default trip information will not be tracked unless the accuracy is correct within ten meters.  This can be changed in preferences.</ul>
				<b>All-Time records don't seem to be updating</b>
				<ul>All-Time records are hard coded to require a minimum of 10 meter accuracy.  If the signal is not strong enough, these records will not be updated.</ul>
				<b>The 'Get Address' button doesn't work</b>
				<ul>This is an issue with the reverse location service in webos that I have no control over.  Unfortunately the only way I've found to fix it is to restart the phone.</ul>
				<b>The altitude is always negative</b>
				<ul>You're below sea level.</ul>
				<b>The app won't install</b>
				<ul>Stop hacking your phone.</ul>
				<b>Why is the address button greyed out?</b>
				<ul>Satellite signal strength is too low to get an accurate fix.</ul>
