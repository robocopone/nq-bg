			<p>
				<b>I get an error saying I haven't accepted the Terms of Service</b>
				<ul>Go to Location Services (Third page in the launcher), and goto the preferences menu.  From there tap "Locate Me Using" and tap "Google Services".  It will then ask you to accept the terms of service.</ul>
				<b>I get an error saying to ensure GPS fixes are turned on</b>
				<ul>Go to Location Services (Third page in the launcher), and goto the preferences menu.  From there tap "Locate Me Using" and tap "GPS".</ul>
				<b>I get an error saying I'm blacklisted</b>
				<ul>The only time I've seen this happen is when the app asks your permission to use Location Services and you either decline, or close the app without responding.  As far as I know, the only way to clear the error is to restart the phone.</ul>
				<b>Top Speed goes down unexpectedly</b>
				<ul>By default the app will reset the top speed when you shake the phone.  This behavior can be changed in preferences.</ul>
				<b>Whats the deal with the accuracy</b>
				<ul>By default trip information will not be tracked unless the accuracy is correct within ten meters.  This can be changed in preferences.</ul>
				<b>All-Time records don't seem to be updating</b>
				<ul>All-Time records are hard coded to require a minimum of 10 meter accuracy.  If the signal is not strong enough, these records will not be updated.</ul>
				<b>The 'Get Address' button doesn't work</b>
				<ul>This is an issue with the reverse location service in webos that I have no control over.  Unfortunately the only way I've found to fix it is to restart the phone.</ul>
