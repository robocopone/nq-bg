This is a list of tasks which need to be done before nq is released as
a GAP 4 package.

17 Aug 2002:  None if the  following items are critical.  Therefore, I
postpone all of this until after the package is released.

-- The configure script should check if the package is installed as a
   GAP package

-- NilpotentQuotient() should return a quotient system.

-- Update the test files and testNq.

-- Add access to the Engel options.

-- If configure cannot find certain components, then one should run
   configure again and not make with the correct options.  This way,
   configure can remember the correct values and it will suffice make.

-- Update installation procedure

-- It should be possible to define the nilpotency class as part of the 
   input file. 

-- Create an info class InfoANU_NQ and put Info() statements into the
   code.
-- Should I keep the last nq-record for what purpose?

-- The exit codes of the standalone should be interpreted.  For this I
   need to go through the code and make sure that each exit events has
   its own exit code.

nq todos:

-- The evaluation of commutators should decrease the class by one
   before computing the two entries of the commutators.  (I have done
   this.  There is some cleaning up necessary as the class is
   sometimes negative)

-- More statistics for the integer routines, for example, the density
   of the input.

-- Make sure that the values returned when the nq exits are correct.
   Then the calling GAP script knows why nq has terminated
   prematurely.  Make sure that the resulting GAP file is consistent
   so that the calling routine can read in partial results.
