			This app is currently awaiting Palm's approval for the app catalog.  This is a simple app 
			that allows you to tap along to anything to find the tempo of it.
			You can then input that tempo into a metronome and have it play the tempo back.  The
			metronome has visual, audible, and vibration alerts.
			<A name="faq"><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></A>
			<p>
				<b>Why does your audio suck</b>
				<ul>Palm's api to play sounds has no guarantees on when the sound will be played.  The audible alerts are no where near accurate unless the app uses the system sounds on board the phone.  This severely limits what I have to work with, so I chose the dial-pad tones.</ul>
