I have taken on the task of bringing NQ up to date.  The scope of the project includes the following...

  * Updating the code to be ANSI C '99 compliant.
  * Dynamic testing of the code for proper memory usage.
  * Checking to see if the code is 64bit safe.
  * Identifying bottlenecks in the algorithms used.
